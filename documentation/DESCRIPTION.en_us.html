    Huninn is an open-source Traditional Chinese rounded typeface designed by <a href="https://justfont.com"
        target="_blank">justfont</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Huninn is based on the Japanese existing open-source font <a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/kosugi-maru"
        target="_blank">Kosugi Maru</a> and the Latin characters were replaced with <a
        href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Varela+Round" target="_blank">Varela Round</a>, to ensure a cohesive and
    high-quality bilingual experience.
</p>
<p>
    The name <strong>Huninn (粉圓)</strong> is inspired by the Taiwanese term for tapioca pearls, reflecting a playful nod
    to local culture. Huninn includes commonly used characters in Taiwan, Bopomofo (Zhuyin) symbols, and even adds Taigi
    and Hokkien phonetic symbols and characters to meet local requirements.
