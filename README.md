![Huninn Cover Image](documentation/cover.png)

Huninn (Á≤âÂúì) is an open-source Traditional Chinese Rounded Typeface project developed by [justfont](https://justfont.com). 

üÜï Huninn is now on [üîó Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Huninn) !

</div>

---

This project was initiated as a way to give back to the community following the success of the 2015 crowdfunding campaign for [JinXuan (ÈáëËê±)](https://blog.justfont.com/2025/03/jinxuan-en/). As promised, an open-source font optimized for Taiwanese users was created and given as a gift to the Taiwanese community. 

The typeface is based on the Japanese existing open-source font [Kosugi Maru (Â∞èÊùâ‰∏∏„Ç¥„Ç∑„ÉÉ„ÇØ)](https://github.com/googlefonts/kosugi-maru), originally developed by Motoya Co., Ltd and the Latin characters were replaced with another open-source font, [Varela Round](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Varela+Round), designed by Joe Prince and Avraham Cornfeld, to ensure a cohesive and high-quality bilingual experience. 

The name **Huninn (Á≤âÂúì)** is inspired by the Taiwanese term for tapioca pearls, reflecting a playful nod to local culture. 

Huninn includes commonly used characters in Taiwan, Zhuyin (Bopomofo) symbols, and even adds Taigi and Hokkien phonetic symbols and characters to meet local requirements.

Released under the [SIL Open Font License 1.1 (OFL 1.1)](https://openfontlicense.org/), Huninn is freely available for anyone to use without restrictions. It can be downloaded and used at no cost, with no requirement to notify or credit us. It is also suitable for commercial projects, as long as the typeface itself is not sold as a standalone product. Users are free to copy, distribute, and install it on any device or software without limitations. Additionally, the typeface can be modified or used as the basis for new works, provided that any derivatives are shared under the same SIL Open Font License.

## Features

The design process involved reworking the original Kosugi Maru font, which featured uneven stroke weights and a distinctly Japanese aesthetic, to better suit Taiwanese typographic tastes. 

Additionally, justfont enhanced the font‚Äôs grayscale rendering and repositioned punctuation to conform to Traditional Chinese standards, improving its practicality for local uses such as documents, web design, and signage.

- **Glyph Expansion**: 
  - Building on this base, justfont tailored the font for everyday use in Taiwan. They expanded it by incorporating 1,477 frequently used Traditional Chinese characters, Taiwanese-specific phonetic symbols like Bopomofo , and characters for Taiwanese Hokkien Romanization (Tai-lo). 
  - In total, our team refined glyph shapes and added over 2,700 characters and symbols to better reflect common usage in Taiwan.
  
- **Design Refinements**: 
  - The character designs were polished to enhance legibility and visual balance. This included fine-tuning stroke weights, adjusting character spacing, and optimizing glyph proportions for a typeface that is both practical and aesthetically pleasing. 
  - Significant effort went into refining the ‚Äúgrayscale‚Äù of the characters, addressing the original‚Äôs inconsistent stroke thicknesses. 
  - We meticulously adjusted each stroke to achieve a more uniform and ideal appearance, ensuring that no characters appear overly dark or faint.
  
- **Typesetting Adjustments**: 
  - The original Kosugi Maru punctuation, designed for Japanese, positioned marks off-center within the grid. 
  - To align with Taiwan‚Äôs typesetting conventions, which require centered punctuation, we made key adjustments in developing open Huninn. 
  - These changes ensure the typeface meets the needs of our local audience effectively.

- **Fully Support jf7000 Charset**:
  - Read more about jf7000 Charset: [justfont/jf7000](https://github.com/justfont/jf7000).
  - Supports Taiwanese and Hakka Romanization writing system, as well as Indigenous Formosan languages.

## Relationship between Huninn and jf-open-huninn

**Huninn** is a fork of ([justfont/open-huninn-font](https://github.com/justfont/open-huninn-font)). Both fonts share the same design and features. However, due to Google Fonts onboarding requirements, **Huninn** adopts Google Fonts metrics (for example, higher `usWinAscent` and `usWinDescent`). For more details, you can refer to [Google Fonts Guide](https://googlefonts.github.io/gf-guide/index) and [C/J vertical metrics requirements #8911](https://github.com/google/fonts/issues/8911).

In contrast, **open-huninn-font** uses justfont own unified font metrics, consistent with other justfont typefaces. This ensures better visual consistency when mixing fonts in layouts.

Since **Huninn** is available on platforms that support Google Fonts, such as Google Docs, please note that if you download documents with Huninn, but later apply jf-open-huninn locally, there may be slight layout shifts. Keep this in mind when switching between the two.
